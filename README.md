We provide OPT acceptance letters to volunteers who spend 2 to 8 hours using Cursor AI with Claude.

Create data visualization samples using our data:

- [Timeline data](https://model.earth/data-commons/docs/data/)
- [USEEIO data](https://model.earth/useeio.js/footprint/)

Backend developers may also use Cloudflare to deploy a sample.

2. Add a folder with your name in the "team" subfolder.
3. Add a brief bio in a README.md file in your folder.

4. Spend 2 to 8 hours using Cursor with Claude and/or Cloudflare to create an app.
