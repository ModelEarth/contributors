# Contributors

We provide OPT acceptance letters to volunteers who spend 2 to 8 hours using [Cursor AI with Claude](https://cursor.com).

Create a data visualization using one or more of our data sources:

- [Google Timeline Data](https://model.earth/data-commons/docs/data/)
- [USEEIO Impact Data](https://model.earth/useeio.js/footprint/)
- [NAICS US Industry Data](https://model.earth/apps/)
- [Global Trade Data](https://model.earth/OpenFootprint/trade/) - coming soon

Backend developers may also use Cloudflare to deploy a sample.

1. Fork our [contributors repo](https://github.com/modelearth/contributors). Turn on GitHub Pages.
2. Add a bio folder with your name in the "team" subfolder.
3. Add a brief bio in a README.md file in your folder. You are welcome to include your resume and/or a link to it.

4. Spend 2 to 8 hours using Cursor with Claude and/or Cloudflare to create an app.

5. Document the process and prompts you use in a subfolder of your team bio folder called "app".

6. Avoid adding data to the contributors repo. Pull directly from GitHub and APIs.

7. Submit a pull request with your bio and sample, then submit our [New Member form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXSX0_myDcB4_Z32hpGC71PXVsMmgy_dyZPY0aPEWamyzV-w/viewform).
